## Introduction
Architecture is one of the fields that excite me the most. Here we appreciate various aspects of architectural drawing aspects from my perspective.

## Fascination
Just look at how beautifully soft pastels are able to mix and produce colors just like we see in many digital artbooks.

Digital artwork is also phenomenal but to bring it to life, we either need a screen or have to print on paper. It is really brilliant for commercial purposes but intelligence and appreciation stems from integrating art into your daily life. Since my childhood, I was never fast enough in art subjects. So in my eleventh grade, I decided to enroll in architectural classes from Mr Tankiwala Sir.

## My Artworks
These artworks are nowhere close to good from artist standards. These are just my beginner exploratory work in the field of drawing. I had to start right from being able to draw a straight line (yes, this was also difficult for me then) on a plane A3 paper. Then lines in different angles, circles, ovals and various patterns as should be usually done in any arts class I presume. 

Adding colors would come at a much later stage when I became somewhat familiar with the concept of sketching. Slowly we were introduced to perspectives and isometric drawings. Being able to visualize an object from various angles, to be able to draw front, side and top view from an isometric drawing and vice versa.

Apart from one point, two point and three points perspectives, one important concept I learned was how shifting the point of perspective reorients objects' relative orientation! Following sketch demonstrates this beautifully.
